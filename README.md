k-means

The implementation of k-means clustering algorithm.
This file prints the cendroids and SSE(Sum of squared errors)
for different values of k (from k = 2 to k = 20) and plots the graph
between k and SSE to find the optimal or knee value of k.

Takes the path of the excel file containing the data as
the command line argument.
